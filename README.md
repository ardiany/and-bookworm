BookWorm is an Android application that allows you to keep track of books you have read and those you intend to read. It is not a book reader. You can enter books by scanning them (product codes), searching for them, or direct form entry. You can rate and comment on each book. Once you have your book list, you can sort and filter it. 

BookWorm is available in the Android Market.
